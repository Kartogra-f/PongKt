# PongKt

A simplistic Pong clone created for learning Kotlin & LibGDX and game programming.
There is not much to be said there apart from the fact that it is my first ever project. I would be more than happy if anyone skilled in Kotlin/LibGDX(KTX) could give me pointers on how to improve and how I could do things differently/better.

This Pong clone was used to learn various amount of things, mainly Composition by delegates, but also LibGDX which I never used before.
